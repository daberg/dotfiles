# Linux .files

A bunch of configuration files I use across my Linux machines.

This setup should be compatible at the very least with any Arch-based system,
provided that the relevant dependencies are satisfied.

The `packagelist` file contains an ever-changing, often-outdated list of
packages from the Arch repos which I keep installed.

Warning: this is repo is regularly rebased to keep history minimal, so that the
merging routine of my machine branches stays as smooth as possible.

## Theme

Gtk applications are configured to use the Arc theme. Use lxappearance and
qt5ct to give Qt applications a consistent look.
